<p>Prior to the Internet, the concept of virtual organizations had existed, but there
were several barriers to their becoming a reality according to Upton and
McAffe (1996).</p>
<p>According to these authors, within the concept of a virtual organization, a single
factory could be replaced by a network of countless manufacturers, each of
them doing what they knew best how to do. There are sectors where these
networks can be identified, such as within the textile and automobile industries.</p>
<p>In many cases, however, the virtual organization cannot be made concrete.
Upton and McAffe posit three requirements for a virtual factory: that it be
capable of incorporating partners at anystage of relationship, that it be able to
include partners at all levels of sophistication in IT, and that it be capable of
providing all the required functionalities. Further, according to these authors,
only IT applications based in the Internet can encompass the entire spectrum
defined by the three above requirements.</p>
<p>Chesbrough and Teece (1996) allege that virtual business has advantages over
traditional, vertically integrated business with regard to participation in a
market where one can freely seek out purchasers and vendors of goods and
services. On the other hand, as benefits increase, the risks, mostly related to
growing problems with coordination, are greater,</p>
<p>Within this perspective of virtual integration via IT application, it is necessary
to clarify the role of ERP, EDI, and the Internet.</p>
<p>While EDI and the Internet have made commercial transactions among
businesses possible via electronic means, one must distinguish one from the
other. EDI permitted an interconnection of businesses via IT, using telephone
connections, private networks and dedicated information systems which must
be dedicated and installed at each new company that is connected. This was
therefore a case by case connection of defined and previously contracted
partners. Because it is based in dedicated telecommunications applications and
infrastructure, it presented a good level of security, even though its cost was
high.</p>
<p>The Internet, in turn, is based on an open protocol, which was conceived to be
tolerant of errors due to the use of redundant paths, with the idea of being a
public network (anyone can access it) of worldwide scope. It permits continued growth and the adherence of new participants without high cost. The level
of security is lower, but the entry and operation are much lower and its coverage
is much greater.</p>
<p>Strategies For The New Economy And Dynamic Competitive Environment</p>
<p>The coverage of integration resulting from IT applications, involving the use of
ERP, EDI, and the Internet can be seen in Figure 7.2. ERP includes information
from the environment of a company (or sometimes a corporation). EDI allows
for the exchange of information with some purchasers and providers who have
specific contracts signed for this purpose. Finally, the Internet allows for the
extension of the integration of the chains of production, including those of
worldwide coverage (Chandrashekar & Schary, 1999; Gereffi, 2001).</p>
<p>In addition, it should be highlighted that there is interaction among these kinds
of IT applications. Experience with EDI created bases for the B2B, while the
growing use of ERP systems that while integrating the various areas of the
organizations and standardizing information processing, facilitated business
integration in the local as well as the worldwide environment (Laurindo &
Pessôa, 2001).</p>
<p>However, it must be stressed that it is not just in buying and selling transactions
that the Internet can have an important impact on businesses, since the range
of IT applications via the Internet involving many business relations is growing
every day.</p>
<p>Hameri and Nihtilä (1997) emphasize Internet use in new product development. They cite the case of a large project involving hundreds of people and
many companies and research institutes in which the Internet played a crucial
role. Thanks to its use, project participants in different places had access to all
the relevant information: engineering plans, three-dimensional models, lists of
parameters, results of prototype tests, and other technical engineering information</p>
    <h4>Figure 7.2. Integration of information via IT applications (adapted from
Chandrashekar & Schary (1999)</h4>
<center><img src="supply%20chains.jpg"></center>
<p>All the project team members could also access information on the project
structure, timetable, and minutes from meetings, and could participate in
discussion groups. They note that the Internet was used primarily to share
information, rather than in an attempt to reinforce collaboration among the
different groups. Internet use also emphasized the importance of milestones to
coordinate the different teams’ participation in the project, which can be seen
in the increase of sharing files on dates close to the milestones.</p>
<h1>Virtual Chains of Production</h1><hr>
<p>The concept of virtual organization can be extended to the entire supply or value
chains (or value systems in the terminology of Porter & Millar, 1985), also
having the use of IT and especially the Internet as a basis.</p>
<p>Chandrashekar and Schary (1999) underscore that the very notion of chains
(originally in the text they treated supply chains, but this can be extended to
chains of value or chains of production in general) contains a virtual component,
since it involves different organizations. For them, virtual chains involve systems
of production and distribution that utilize formal physical structures among
different organizations, with the virtual component deriving from flexibility in the
formation of networks using rapid real-time communication via IT. Members
are often just temporary and frequently enter the chain for specific projects,
without being known to all network participants.</p>
<p>These same authors list the characteristics of a virtual chain:</p>
<p>• operation in real-time in response to consumer orders;</p>
<p>• organization in terms of dominant tasks, instead of general competencies
 of a functional or organizational nature;</p>
<p>• flexible responses to changes in requirements of the market or consumers;</p>
<p>• complementariness of competencies in an orientation by processes;</p>
<p>• direct targeting of the market.</p>
<p>They further point out that such virtual chains operate by means of interrelationships based on reciprocity among complementary businesses, combining
partnership for aggregated value and cooperation to administer the flow of products</p>
<h4>Strategies For The New Economy And Dynamic Competitive Environment</h4>
<p>For them, the governance characteristic of this chain is one of the near
autonomy of its members, which is configured more like a federation than a
hierarchical organization. The virtual chain combines a structure based in IT
with temporary organizations, usually organized by a dominant organizations (a
broker) who involves the temporary partners in specific tasks or projects (a
“meta-organization”).</p>
<p>Virtual chains have a modular structure which can be defined as the capacity
to create goods or complex processes based on small subsystems that can be
independently designed but that function together as a whole (Baldwin & Clark,
1997).</p>
<p>As positive aspects characteristic of these virtual chains, Chandrashekar and
Schary (1999) highlight the orientation toward consumers and products, the
opportunity for this orientation to direct production and distribution of goods
in several chains, the orientation toward specific tasks and rapid responses.
Additionally, they emphasize the flexibility in choice of partners for production
and distribution.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they also point out some negative aspects, such as the focus on
the short-term, which makes longer-term horizontal partnerships more difficult,
and can generate problems of trust, given the transitory nature of these
relationships.</p>
<h1>The Internet and Virtual Chains</h1><hr>
<p>As seen in Chapter III, Gereffi (2001) identified the existence of three kinds of
global chains of production according to the agent who exercises governance
of the chain. Initially he identified the chains directed by the producer (producer-driven chains) and those directed by the buyer (buyer-driven chain),</p>
<center>
<h3>Table 7.1. Internet oriented chains (adapted from Gereffi, 2001)</h3>
    <img src="industries.jpg"></center>
<p>later added the chains of production directed by the Internet (internet-oriented
chains) whose characteristics are listed in Table 7.1 and which will be discussed
in the following.</p>
<p>The Internet is the basis ofe-commerce and ofe-business which for Gereffi are
concepts that go beyond the technological aspect, since they make possible
profound changes in the organization of business, in market structure, in
governmental regulation, in human experience and finally in the competitive
dynamics of global chains.</p>
<p>As seen previously, the two most important forms of electronic commerce are
business-to-consumer — B2C or business-to-business — B2B.</p>
<p>B2C markets have to do with the transfer of goods and services to individual
consumers, i.e., it is a retail model. B2B markets refer to procurement
(research to acquire goods, prices and suppliers), logistical and the administrative processes among companies, therefore this is a model of supply chain. The
volume of transactions on the B2B is much greater than on the B2C, corresponding to 80% of what is marketed via e-commerce, whose total was
US$401 billion in 2000 (Gereffi, 2001).</p>
<p>According to this same author, the potential that the Internet has to transform
the global chains (producer-driven as well as buyer-driven) is due to two
factors:</p>
<p>• it permits the creation of economies of scales and at a level of efficiency
that was not possible formerly;</p>
<p>• it makes possible radical change in the structure of business, exercising a
“pull” instead of a “push” effect on production, replacing stock withinformation that make production possible, and expediting items only
when there is a real demand by consumers.</p>
<center>
<h3>Table 7.2. Organizational chain of the Internet (adapted from Gereffi,2001)</h3>
<img src="organization.png"></center>
<p>information that make production possible, and expediting items only
when there is a real demand by consumers.</p>
<p>This last aspect appears to be a long-term trend in many industries, since there
are advantages in this model of producing against orders (build to order), allied
with a focus on customer satisfaction, such as the case of Dell in Chapter I. The
strategy of pushing in supply-chain management (SCM) is imbedded in
concepts well disseminated in the business environment, such as mass
customization, lean production, and lean retailing.</p>
<p>The organizational chain of the Internet involves service providers, producers
of hardware and software, needed to make viable the grand worldwide
network which interconnects millions of computers and thousands of servers,
as shown in Table 7.2.</p>
<p>However, this new form of command of the global chains proposed by Gereffi
(2001) is questioned by Humphrey et al. (2003), among others, who defend the
position that while the Internet has had an important role in global commerce,
it retains the preexisting governance structures.</p>
<h3>Intermediation via Internet</h3>
<hr style="border-width:2px;border-color:black">
<p>While the Internet has made direct sales to consumers possible, thus eliminating
the need for some kinds of intermediation, Gereffi stresses that one of the prime
effects attributed to the Internet has been the appearance of new forms of
electronic intermediation that have important impact on business strategies.</p>
<P>Upton nd McAffe (1996) stress that information brokers appeared with the
Internet. They do the integrating that makes the existence of virtual factories
possible. These intermediaries perform an important function in the electronic
markets.</P>
<p>For Ehrens and Zapf (1999) these new intermediaries are the “metamediaries”
who go beyond linking buyers and providers, and make services available to
facilitate their transactions. Gereffi (2001) created another, similar term to
name the players who carry out this role: “infomediaries”.
</p>
<p>In the context of B2C, Gereffi understands infomediaries to be the companies
that provide on-line access to consumers, while they collect valuable information about their consuming habits (which is the basis of the CRM systems that</p>
<p>we will see soon). Normally, these infomediaries in the B2C represent theinterests of consumers who are to attain the advantages of using the Internet.However, they are also associated with producers, vendors and traditional
intermediaries. In B2C, there are dominant infomediaries, such as AOL,
Yahoo! (in Brazil we have examples such as UOL) who control the portals that allow Internet access.</p>
<p>In turn, in the B2B ambit, large businesses make their presence known. Even
though there are infomediaries independent of them, the biggest initiatives are
related to the large companies. An important example exists in the automobile
industry with the Covisint portal that unites acquisition of supplies for General
Motors, Ford, Daimler/Chrysler, and Renault/Nissan.</p>
<p>In Ehren and Zapf’s (1999) conception, metamediaries are agents independent
of the buying and selling companies. Market characteristics which favor the
appearance of metamediaries are: large scale markets, fragmented supply
chains, nondifferentiation of products and vendors, high cost for procuring
information, high cost for product comparison, and high cost for processing
purchases. Although in situations where there is no dominant oligopoly, neither
are the product brand names an important differentiating agent.</p>
<p>According to Kaplan and Sawhney (2000), a similar, better disseminated
concept is that of “e-hubs”, which are virtual markets among companies (B2B
marketplaces). E-hubs can neutral, i.e., belong to “independent” companies,
close to the concept of infomediaries or metamediaries (for example, a
software provider) or biased, i.e., companies that participate in the transaction
that occur. Rudberg et al. (2002) subdivide this last situation into two others:
those where one or more large companies participating in the market own and
administer the marketplace, or situations where there is a consortium among the
market companies and the providers of the technology platform.</p>
<p>E-hubs can be vertical (serving a specific industry) or horizontal (serving
several industries). Rudberg et al. (2002) includes a third category, with vertical
as well as horizontal coverage to serve a specific segment, which they call
mega-exchanges. For horizontal e-hubs, success is determined by standardization and cost reduction. In verticale-hubs, companies usually seek competitive advantages as rapid responses to the uncertainties of dynamic markets.</p>
<p>E-hub clients purchase either operational products, which are not part of the
final product, such as office supplies, or inputs for manufacturing, which are part
of the final product or of the manufacturing process, such as raw materials or
components.</p>
<p>E-hubs perform either systematic or spot operations to serve the different ways
companies buy. Note that systematic purchases involve contracts negotiatedwith qualified providers while in spot purchases, the buyers aim to satisfy their immediate needs at the lowest cost possible.</p>
<center><h4><span>Figure 7.3. Structure of the electronic B2B markets (adapted from
    Rudberg et al., 2002)</span></h4>
    <img src="b2b.png"></center>
<p>with qualified providers while in spot purchases, the buyers aim to satisfy their
immediate needs at the lowest cost possible.</p>
    <p>Thus, according to the forms cited above,the <i>B2B electronic marketplaces</i>
will have structures like those designed in Figure 7.3 (Rudberg et al., 2002).</p>
    <p>Kaplan and Sawhney (2000) identify four different types of <i>e-hubs</i>(and give
respective examples), according to the type of product the client purchases —
either operational or manufacturing — and by the kind of operation, whether
systematic or spot (Figure 7.4):</p>
    <h3>• MRO (maintenance, repair, and operating): horizontal e-hubs that
sell systematically. Examples: Ariba, W.W. Grainger, MRO.com,
    BizBuyer.com.</h3>
 <center><P><i>Figure 7.4. Classification of e-hubs (adapted from Kaplan & Sawhney,
2000)</i></P>
<img src="mro.png"></center>
<p><b>• Yield manager:</b>horizontal e-hubs that perform spot selling. Examples:
Employease, Adauctiuon.com, Capacity<i>Web</i>.com.</p>
<p><b>•Exchanges:</b>vertical e-hubs that perform spot operations. Examples: eSteel, PaperExchange.com, Altra Energy, IMX Exchange.</p>
<p><b>• Catalog:</b>vertical e-hubs that sell systematically. Examples: Chemdex,
SciQuest.com, PlasticsNet.com.</p>
<p>Kaplan and Sawhney also cite another <i>e-hub</i>format: the reverse aggregators
where buyers in a specific horizontal or vertical market get together to make
purchases, thus increasing their bargaining power and adding other correlated
services.</p>
<p>Gereffi (2001) sees three kinds of impact the Internet has had on competition
in the global chains:</p>
<p>• The Internet leading the creation of information intermediaries, which
results in a whole gamut of strategic and organizational changes;</p>
<p>• The Internet inverting the logic of the producer or retailer in favor of the
consumer, i.e., expanding the scope of the buyer-drive chains, as long as
producers do not use the capacity of the Internet to facilitate mass
customization;</p>
<p>• The impact of the Internet (B2B as well as B2c) being absorbed and
integrated into the practices of the dominant players already existing in
various industries, promoting the integration of business transactions
involving producers, retailers, and consumers.</p>
<p>Note that, corroborating the third scenario envisioned by Gereffi (2001), more
and more traditional (brick and mortar) businesses, leaders in producer-driven
or buyer-driven chains are becoming active in e-business using the Internet as
an additional channel. These are being called “click and mortar” companies,
which ally the traditional to the virtual side.</p>
<p>Rudberg et al. (2002) see yet another consequence of Internet use: competition
that takes place not just within the ambit of businesses, but among chains.
Under these circumstances, companies participating in the same chain have
adopted a more collaborative focus.</p>
<h2>Revolution or Evolution:
That is the Question</h2>
<hr style="border-width:2px;border-color: black">
<p>One point that has generated controversy lies in determining whether the nature
of <i>e-business</i> applications based on the Internet is evolutionary or revolutionary. Michael Porter (2001) and Don Tapscott (2001) are figures who are
emblematic of this discussion. Both take the view that the Internet is a powerful
technology, which greatly increases operational efficiency and opens up new
business opportunities. Both also agree that it was used in an erroneous manner
by many companies in the euphoria of the explosion of <i>e-commerce</i>and <i>e-business</i> during the second half of the 1990s. However, each sees different
reasons for and consequences of what has occurred.</p>
<p>Porter defends the idea that the Internet is the most powerful IT tool that has
yet existed to implement a distinctive strategy, but it should follow the
traditional, consecrated principles of competitive strategy. On the other side,
Tapscott counter-argues that there has not yet been time for the revolutionary
impact of <i>e-business</i> to be perceived clearly and that traditional strategies
cannot keep up with the pace of changes imposed by the dissemination of the
Internet.</p>
<p>Both points of view are presented in the following.</p>
<h2>The Internet Following the Principles of Strategy</h2>
<hr style="border-width: 2px;border-color: black">
<p>For Porter (2001), the first market signals captured when <i>e-commerce</i> and <i>e-business </i>began to operate were illusory, because businesses were faced with
a new, important, and promising technology. The reality of both earnings and
costs was distorted by the concession of discount prices and investing
according to the desire for results on the stock market.</p>
<p>Thus, in Porter’s view, <i>e-business</i> competitors have disobeyed the precepts of
good strategy in numerous ways:</p>
<p>First, in the rush to show short-term results, the “dot.com” enterprises
promoted veritable indiscriminant “hunts” for clients, by granting unreal discounts, through incentives to channels and publicity, instead of seeking profit;
in other words, seeking sales and not results. In the same line of conduct, they
sought income from publicity and in rates for clicks per site, instead of
concentrating on delivering value to clients in order to “deserve” a premium
price.</p>
<p>There was also a lot of precipitation in offering just any product or service,
instead of searching out the necessary trade-offs (see Chapter I), i.e., solutions
of compromise between meeting the needs and anxieties of consumers and
attaining a level of operational efficiency compatible with their activities.</p>
<p>The Internet, since it is available to everyone, can lead to competition based
solely on lower prices, and can end up eroding the industry’s profitability. To
make the Internet a source of generating value, Porter warns us to look beyond
the immediate market signs and focus on two fundamental factors for determining profitability:</p>
<p>• the industry structure, which determines the average profitability of the
competitor in the industry;</p>
<p>• sustainable competitive advantage, which makes it possible for a company to profit more than the industry average.</p>
<p>Porter does not consider the generic classification of the New Economy of
<i>business-to-consumer</i> (B2C) and <i>business-to-business </i>(B2B) to have importance in determining profit potential. Potential profitability can only be
understood by analyzing each specific industry.
The impacts that the Internet can have on each of the five competitive forces of
an industry are summarized in Table 7.3. Note that the effects in general lead
to increased competition, which reduces the perspective for profits.
Porter likewise disputes that there are advantages in being the first mover on the
Internet, since the cost of change is low and it is hard to create a trademark
exclusively on the Internet.</p>

    <center>
<h3><i>Table 7.3. Effects of the Internet on the competitive forces of an industry
(adapted from Porter, 2001)</i></h3>
        <img src="porter.png"></center>
<p>In addition, the Internet has caused other problems, such as the outsourcing of key
activities and the indiscriminant formation of partnerships, which causes the loss of
important proprietary advantages.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Porter also detects positive aspects of the Internet. For him, the
Internet is the largest IT platform developed to date to reinforce strategic
distinctive positioning, due to its range of coverage and uniformization of the
internal standards of an organization’s information system.</p>
<p>As seen earlier, in Chapter I, for Porter, the creation of a sustainable
competitive advantage can come from operational efficiency (doing the same
things as the competitors, but in a better way) or from strategic positioning
(doing different things than the competitors do). Given the broad dissemination
of the Internet, the large gains that it can mean in terms of operational efficiency
(flexibility, speed, etc.) can be copied easily. When all businesses are on the
Internet, this will no longer be a source of advantage for gains in efficiency, and
will become a qualifying criterion, no longer a winner of orders, according to
the classification proposed by Slack (1993).</p>
<p>On the other hand, Porter recognizes that the Internet has opened a new wide
range of opportunities for sustainable strategic positioning, such as new
product features or services or even different logistical arrangements.</p>
<p>Contrary to what many believe, Porter does not think that the Internet is
revolutionary for the majority of established industries and companies. While
it has created some new industries (such as on-line auctions and electronic
markets), Porter understands that its main effect have been to reshape
preexisting industries, that experienced restrictions due to the high cost of
communications, of collecting information and of transactions.</p>
<p>Contrary to what many believe, Porter does not think that the Internet is

preexisting industries, that experienced restrictions due to the high cost of
communications, of collecting information and of transactions.</p>
<p>For this author, more solid competitive advantages derive from more traditional
sources, such as differentiated products, proprietary content, and distinctive
physical activities. Rarely has the Internet annulled sources of competitive
advantage: usually it makes them more valuable, especially the creation of
distinctive positions.</p>
<p>According to Porter, to obtain competitive advantage via the Internet, a
radically new approach to business is not necessary, but one can use the
principles of good strategy. This explains the reason that many traditional
companies have obtained good results using the Internet as one more channel,
rather than a separate business (moving from brick and mortar to click and
mortar). The best way of using its potential is to integrate physical and virtual
activities, such as for example, creating a good postsales service team to
service clients who have made purchases via <i>e-commerce</i>.</p>
<p>Within the approach, which proposes the use of traditional tools of structural
analysis for an industry, Porter seen no need for the distinction between B2B
and B2C. Further: he sees no “New Economy,” but rather an old economy with
access to a new and powerful technology. There is thus no rupture, since “in our
anxiety to see how the Internet is different, we failed to see how the Internet is
the same”.</p>
<p>Thus, according to this line of thinking, the route to efficacious use of the
Internet is the necessary employment of a strategic vision for its use in order to
make new forms of organization and relationships among companies viable.</p>
<h3>Internet Revolutionizing Strategy</h3>
<hr style="border-width: 2px;border-color:black">
<p>Tapscott’s (2001) view is directly contrary to Porter’s (2001), since he
understands the Internet and the New Economy to be revolutionary.</p>
<p>Firstly, he highlights the grand role of the Internet in forming networks that have
made partnerships for outsourcing and processing a reality that has led to the
success of numerous companies. Among these cases, he cites the companies
that rather than producing have taken on a role as integrators, such as Boeing,
IBM, and Mercedes Benz. He also points to the growth of contract manufacturing (such as the well-known Celstica Flextornics and Soletron) as signs of
the correctness of this strategy. He also contests the idea that this eliminates
competitive advantage as well as the claim that verticalization would be a better
alternative.</p>
<p>Tapscott believes that the Internet is much more than a simple natural evolution
of IT applications. It represents a qualitatively new resource for universal
communication. The public nature of the Internet, allied to its growing reach and
functionality, has produced a scenario that is revolutionizing the corporate
structure of the industrial era and forging new paths for competitive strategy.
This new structure, allying technology to this new way of doing business,
Tapscott has called the <i>business web or b-web</i>. He defines this as any system
composed of suppliers, distributors, service providers, infrastructure, and
clients who use the Internet for business communications and transactions.</p> 
<p>He also emphasizes that it is not just pure-player companies that are making
gains with this. On the contrary, the greatest beneficiaries are the traditional
companies, which are more and more undertaking partnerships to develop their
businesses.</p>
<p>For this author, it is important to perceive that the Internet is still undergoing
evolution and that much of its potential has yet to be explored. It is growing and
learning from the use of the technology. In this way, the Internet will be the
infrastructure of the economy of the 21st century just as the electricity,
railroads, highways, and other transportation systems served this purpose at
the beginning of the 20th century.</p>
<p>However, the Internet has already produced unquestionable gains by reducing
the costs of transactions, facilitating searches, coordinating and contracting
among companies, different from the traditional model of the industrial era,
which included the emphasis on verticalization. Tapscott understands the term
<i>business model</i> to mean a company’s central architecture, especially as it
develops and deploys all relevant resources (not just those within the limits of
the corporation) to create differentiated values for the clients.</p>
<p>Tapscott lists six reasons for the existence of a New Economy:</p>
<ol>
<li><h2>New Infrastructure for the Creation of Wealth</h2>Networks, especially
the Internet, are becoming the basis for economic activity and progress,
in the same way that railroads, highways, electricity, and telephones are
for the vertically-integrated corporations.</li>
<li><h2>New Models for Business.</h2>The companies of the New Economy should
not be understood to be those of the Internet or the “dot.coms”, but
companies that use the Internet infrastructure to create efficacious models
for business based in the <i>b-web</i>.</li>
<li><h2>New Sources of Value.</h2>In today’s economy, value is created by the
brain, not muscle,s and the majority of work is focused on knowledge.</li>
<li><h2>The New Proprietors of Wealth.</h2>Powerful investors own the majority
of industrial capital goods. At the beginning of the 21st century, 60% of
Americans owned shares of stock and the largest shareholders are the
workers’ pension funds. In addition, economic growth will be located in
small businesses</li>
<li><h2>New Institutions and Educational Models.</h2>Private companies, and
not public institutions, will meet the growing demand for educational
services. The pedagogical model is changing with the increase in interactivity
and learning focused on the student. Universities will become places on
the communication network and not just places where people go to study.</li>
 <li><h2>New Forms of Governance.</h2>The bureaucracy of the industrial era grew
simultaneously with the vertically-integrated corporations and imitatedtheir structure. New governmental structures based on the Internet permit cooperation between public and private organizations to deliver services
to citizens. This is called <i>e-government</i>. One can imagine similar changes
in democratic procedures (as, for example, in the electoral process) and
in the relationship between citizen and state.</li>
<p>Orthodox strategic thinking does not allow the exploration of these new
opportunities, which Tapscott calls “innovation in the business model”, or the
search for new tools, including strategic concepts and methods for analysis to
understand and explore business architectures such as the b-webs. In these
circumstances companies can greatly benefit from resources they do not own,
because of the network environment. They can thus concentrate on their
essential competencies, searching both inside and outside, via the Internet, for
better components of operational activities and projects, to obtain the best
solutions at lower cost.</p>
<p>Porter’s idea that the Internet neutralizes sources of competitive advantage is
contested by Tapscott, who argues that companies have different efficacies in
implementing its use.</p>
<p>Tapscott does recognize, however, that the second half of the 1990s was a bad
time for strategy, since it was believed that everything done on the Internet
would be profitable, which did not turn out to be true. He also recognizes that
rivalry among competitors was sharpened, the barriers to admissions diminished and that bargaining power of buyers and suppliers increased. But this
does not justify denying that the Internet significantly changed the economy.
There will be a need for strategy, but it will be a strategy consonant with the new
times.</p>
<h2>Final Considerations and Perspectives</h2>
<hr style="border-width: 2px;border-color: black">
<p>The discussion of the turbulent environment of the New Economy goes further
than the role of IT in organizations. As the reader has been able to observe, the
heralds of the New Economy have a strategic approach devoted to the
dynamism of the process of formulating and implementing strategies.</p>
<p>In their articles <i>“Making strategy:</i> <i>Learning by doing”</i> and “<i>Strategy as
simple rules”,</i> by Christensen (1997) and Eisenhardt and Sull (2001) respectively, the authors make clear the need for integration between the formulationand implementation of strategy, to form a continuous process, with constant
feedback to avoid strategy becoming precociously obsolete due to the rapid
rate of change in the environment.</p>
<p>But it is important that the reader not understand these recommendations as a
negation of the structured process of analysis and the formulation of strategy,
but as a warning about the need for a more agile process, one which is strongly
connected to daily operations.</p>
<p>One concept that can help to comprehend the need for organizations to respond
to change and to maintain their competitiveness is resilience, i.e. the ability to
absorb the competitive environment and respond with efficacy to this turbulence (Starr et al., 2002).</p>
<p>In this way, the holistic-strategic model developed over the course of this book
is ready for the New Economy, concerning itself with the issue of the dynamism
of the strategic processes, with the interconnectedness of business, the speed
of the IT revolution and the changes that the economy and the society are
undergoing at the start of this century.</p>
<p>However, all the strategic concepts and support techniques are, explicitly or
implicitly, included in the model and they should not be neglected due to a
priority on immediate responses. In sum, exchanging consistently developed
analyses via checklists and ad hoc scripts is unnecessarily risky.</p>
<P>Therefore, with a good implementation process, guided by continuous monitoring of the environmental changes and making use of IT and virtual resources,
one can use the enduring consecrated models in an agile, quick, and integrated
manner</P>

<h2>Case Studies: Strategy and
Decisions in Perspective</h2>
<hr style="border-width: 2px;border-color: black">
<h2>Case – Uniting the New and Old Economy and Profiting
from It: Magazine Luiza</h2>
    <hr style="border-width: 2px;border-color: black"></center>
    <p>Magazine Luiza, one of the four largest department store chains in Brazil (billing
of R$588 million in 2201) was founded in 1957, in França, a city in the stateof São Paulo. It had 127 stores in 2002, located in 105 cities in five states: São
Paulo, Minas Gerais, Paraná, Mato Grosso do Sul and Pará.</p>
<p>In 1992, (before commercial use of the Internet!) this company launched the
pioneering concept of “Virtual Stores”, which are establishments without
products in stock or on display, where the client makes purchases with the aid
of multimedia terminals and trained salespeople. In 2002, 34 of their total stores
were virtual, billing R$48 million in 2001. Beginning in 2002, their virtual and
conventional sales departments were unified (they were already working in an
integrated fashion) and the virtual area disseminated its experiences to the rest
of the company.</p>
<p>While the majority of businesses that began to work via the Internet had serious
problems and reduced investments in this area, Magazine Luiza enjoyed
success with its initiative.</p>
<p>What was the difference that meant success where so many others failed in
Brazil?</p>
<p>As other retail stores separated their virtual from their conventional operations
and worked to adapt themselves to the virtual world, Magazine Luiza did the
opposite: its virtual operations were always integrated with its conventional
ones and followed the traditional retail precepts. Backed up by the strength of
its brand name, it used the Internet to expand its chain to cities where there were
still no physical stores, but demand for products existed. To do so, it adopted
a creative solution: its virtual stores are small establishments (at 15% of the cost
of conventional stores) which neither display merchandise nor maintain stock.
To consult the product catalog (electronics, household appliances, furniture
and bath, table and bedroom accessories) eight computer terminals are used to
make purchases, always in the company of a salesperson. Prior to the existence
of the Internet with its graphic resources, products were presented to customers through the use of video. Products were delivered to clients within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Hence, instead of betting on just the construction of a user-friendly and wellplanned site, the company also invested in human contact to leverage sales.
Service by trained salespeople was the key to its operations. They talked with
the client, explaining the methods of payment and showing the daily specials.
Further, the stores promoted courses on the use of the products it sold to
consumers, as well as the use of electronic commerce.</p>
<p>With its acquired experience, the company began to sell at a distance via its
Internet site, even reaching customers in the capital of São Paulo.</p>
<p>Internet assisted sales (both local and remote) also allowed Magazine Luiza to
collect a considerable amount of information on customer habits. Using these
data based, it could advantageously target its marketing campaigns. For
example, it could offer a flat surface television screen to those who had already
purchased a DVD. In this way, CRM is one more important application of IT
to support its strategy.</p>
<p>All this required a significant IT infrastructure, which had to include a new
integrated management system and an intranet connecting all its stores.</p>

<h2>Case – Intermediation Using Portals</h2>
<hr style="border-width: 2px;border-color: black">
<p>Some existing initiatives illustrate the idea of electronic intermediation.</p>
<h3><i>CVRD</i></h3>
        <hr style="border-width: 1px;border-color: black"></center>
<p>The Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) is developing a portal together with
13 other large mining companies, which will market minerals such as iron,
copper, or aluminum. To do so, it has created a separate company,
Velepontocom, which will be devoted to electronic commerce and CVRD’s
strategy on the Internet. It aims to reach a larger number of buyers, principally
the small and medium-sized companies, which in traditional commerce would
have difficulty in negotiating directly with the large mining companies. Small
providers will also be beneficiaries of the initiative. The logistical area of the
CVRC will tend to grow with the portal, since it will be able to provide services
to an increasing range of clients. However, the contracts in this market tend to
be of a long-term nature and require a lot of negotiation, which will still demand
direct contact. This portal can be considered an example of an <i>e-hub</i> of the
catalog type (Guimarães, 2001).</p>
<p>NetCana, an initiative involving smaller companies, has set itself up in the sugar
cane production sector, by developing the NetCana portal. The main idea was
to eliminate intermediaries and reduces the cost of purchasing items unrelated
to the focus of the business, such as office supplies, spare parts, fertilizers,
sacks or agricultural equipment. Initially it will include the producing refineries
in the state of São Paulo, as well as their potential suppliers of operational items.</p>
<p>The refineries’ bargaining power will be considerably greater compared to
purchasing individually. For the suppliers, it represents an opportunity to be
accessed by a much greater number of buyers. This is a case of reverse
    aggregation (Sordili, 2001).</p>
        <p>Adapted from news in the <i>Exame </i>Portal.</p>
<h2>Case – EMBRAER, Virtually Flying</h2>
<hr style="border-width: 2px;border-color: black">
<p>Embraer, symbol of the successful Brazilian company in the high technology,
globalized market, is an important example of the strategic use of IT in the
perspective of networks which integrate and propel business.</p>
<p>To achieve this level of performance, the company followed the vision of
serving clients’ needs and desires by developing products at low cost and within
the timeframe demanded by the market it knew well.</p>
<p>IT was allied to the company’s overall strategy and made Embraer an
international example in terms of product development, within the characteristic
model of the New Economy: creating networks of clients and suppliers who
participated together in projects, sharing information and taking on risks.</p>
<p>By adopting this concept, the development time for Embraer’s new family of
commercial airplanes fell from five to 3.2 years.</p>
<p>This enormous project involved 2,500 people (1,000 from Embraer and 1,500
from partners) from sixteen companies in eight countries (Brazil, France, the
USA, Germany, Belgium, Japan, Switzerland, and Spain) connected through
an extranet (private network among companies created by Embraer following
the Internet standards).</p>
<p>Through this network, projects participants could access a collaborative portal
where information on the project was exchanged, including design files (with
    <b>CAD</b> tools), which are usually very large and would have to be transferred by
    mailing diskettes or <b>CD</b>s.</p>
<p>The digital model, one of the main tools available in the portal, is a large threedimensional file which represents the airplane at its exact stage of development
and can be updated on line with each change made by the teams. Thus it is
guaranteed that all those involved are working on the same version of the same
project, without delays or duplication of information</p>
<p>Tests are done at a Center of Virtual Reality using three-dimensional images on
a screen which is almost two and a half meters high. With special glasses andhelmets, the engineers can examine and develop the digital model in real size,which is quicker and less cumbersome than having to wait for the construction
of a physical model.</p>
<p>Thus, the use of IT aligned with a strategy, taking advantage of virtual chains
has been decisive in gaining competitive advantages.</p>

<h2>An Overview Of
The Decision-Making
Process In
Organizations</h2>
<h4>Introduction: Situations and Facts
that Affect Organizations</h4>
<hr style="border-width: 2px;border-color: black">
</center>
<p>Organizations frequently find themselves faced with serious decision-making
problems. An individual can analyze the problem and choose the better
alternative in an entirely informal manner. In an organization, the problems are
much broader and more complex, involving risk and uncertainty. They require
the opinion and participation of many people at different levels of hierarchy. The
decision-making process in a business or organization should be structured and
resolved in a formal, detailed, consistent, and transparent manner.</p>
<p>Political events such as the end of the Soviet Empire and the consequent fall of
the Berlin Wall, the Petroleum War, the invasion of Iraq, conflicts in various
countries, terrorism, etc., immediately affect the destiny and behavior of nations
or organizations. As everyone knows, Japan, which had been demolished by
the Second World War, became a world economic power in just a few
decades, thanks to massive economic aid from the West in the postwar periodsocial reconstruction, and the joint efforts of its government and people.
Nevertheless, beginning in 1989, the year called the “turning point” of the
Japanese economy, there were abrupt changes in politics and the economy that
resulted in the fall of the Japanese economic index (Dow Nikkey) from 39,000
yen to 14,000 yen. The Japanese economy underwent a contraction that
included the phenomenon known as the bursting of the “bubble”, and the
country’s economy still has not fully recovered from its devastating effects.
Countries and organizations constantly have to face problems due to changes
in governmental regimes (communist, socialist or capitalist) and economic
stability.</p>
<p>World financial crises provoked by financial speculators have made it clear that
the practical and theoretical knowledge in economy or finance are only the
starting background to confront the market of financial speculation. What has
proved necessary has been the experience and level of expertise of someone
familiar with the financial trading tables in order to make choices in dealing with
the alternatives in day-to-day or moment-to-moment financial operations, and
many other factors (see the Case Study - LTCM, presented at the end of this
chapter).</p>
<p> Other problems such as the globalization of the world economy, the need to
manage the environment, combat poverty, etc., affect an organization’s choice
of strategy.</p>
<center><h3>Procedures for Analyzing a Strategic Decision-Making
    Situation</h3></center>
<hr style="border-width:2px;border-color: black">
<p>Problems of strategic decision-making can be structured and analyzed through
methodologies and instruments provided by Operations Research and Management Science (Hillier & Liebermann, 1980; Cook & Russel, 1993),
augmented by knowledge of organizational theory (Simon, 1958, 1997; Cyert
    & March, 1963; Bass, 1983), sociology, psychology, etc</p>
<p>Simon (1997) stresses that the solution to any decision problems in the
business, scientific, or artistic areas can be visualized in four stages: the
perception of the need for a decision or an opportunity, the formulation of
action alternatives, evaluation of the alternatives in terms of their respective
contributions, and the choice of one or more activities to be carried out.</p>
<p>One can say that a strategic decision-making situation can be analyzed and
resolved in the following phases: 1) Select: Select an appropriate strategy; 2)</p>
